"Chiquita's charisma, Rami's stylish rap, Ahyeon's unique voice tone are worth dying for️"
"Ahyeon/Ruka and Rami/Asa are the rap duos you must look out for. Their voices complement one another so well. Pairing these four together was a perfect decision. Rora, Chiquita, and Pharita's deep voices are addictive."
"I never expected it to be black and white, but now that it is, I love it more than anything! Every single member was just amazing!!
btw I love Ahyeon's rough voice in the rap, she ate it up"
最初のチキタの表情と動き好きすぎる
"Rami's rap is so amazing, she is so talented, she sings, dances and now raps WOW Rami deserves applause"
Rami voice and rap!!? Asa and Ahyeon rap!!? Chiquita vocal!!? Rora and Pharita voice!!? Ruka visual!!? Everything is perfect babymonster never disappoint
Ruka literally gave us the best flow of the song…. She brings old YG vibes back and we all loveeee that
"This comeback is so 2gen coded. And giving Rami/ Ahyeon/ Ruka/ Asa a rap together was such a genius idea. Can't wait for the other songs to drop!
I also think ""Walking like a boss, we make 'em talk talk"" will be the iconic line."
It was GENIUS to put Ahyeon/Ruka and Rami/Asa's verses together. The contrast between sweet swaggy Ahyeon/Asa voices and deep confident 2gen coded Rami/Ruka was GORGEOUS 
"Rami's rap, Asa's coolness, Ruka's swag, Rora's vocal, Chiquita's expression, pharita's visual and Ahyeon's move is Just "
와아지 후렴 전환부분 노래중 가장 좋음 이거지....잘만들수있잖아
Chiquita's facial expressions + Rora's visual + Pharita's style + Ahyeon's rap was 
"Canny's Intro with Rora and Pharita was incredible, Ahyeon's rap is perfect, Ruka is certainly unforgettable, Rami is remarkable and flawless, Asa ends the raps with a flourish and YG party at the end is everything we loved, WOW JUST A MASTERPIECE"
"Rami bener kemampuan rapnya mengejutkan. Vokal, Rap, Dance gila Rami all rounded! Ahyeon dengan suaranya yang unik, paling mudah dikenal. Asa dan Ruka karismanya ga bisa bohong. Rora disini swag banget, pemakaian topinya iconic. Jujur, parita cantik banget di video ini. Canny maknae terbaik. Komposisi Baby Monster emang gila!!! Sampai sekarang susah milih favorit, karena semuanya terlalu keren"
"BabyMonster is a group in which even the main vocalist raps like a main rapper. Now, we can say that they're 7 vocalists, 7 rappers, 7 dancers, and 7 visuals. It is the most all-rounded group of this generation honestly."
노래도 MV도 이렇게 멋있을 줄은 몰랐어요! babymonster 너희들 너무 멋있어 다음곡도 기다릴게 Keep up the spirit 
The switch between Ahyeon's high swaggy rap to Ruka's deep flow and and then you get similar atmosphere with Asa and Rami with their unique delivery and voice tones. I've never been so proud of our girls like today🥹
"Chiquita's swag is out of this world wow this concept suits them so well. Rami's rap was fire. Rora's visuals OMG. Pharita was giving us princess of hip hop. Ahyeon, Ruka and Asa really ate as the main rappers of this group. DEVOURED."
The best of comeback and finally trending on youtube.
이런 식으로 조용히 아작내는 힙합이 베몬에게 젤 잘 어울리는 듯. 힙합으로 전율 돋게 만드는 여돌은 처음이다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"Ahyeon Ruka Rami Asa, their Rapp was just Mind blowing!! My jaw literally dropped!!
BABYMONSTER has become an ICONIC group!!"
여태 나온 노래중 제일 와이지스럽고 어울리면서 좋은듯
"Rami’s rap is so amazing, she is so talented, she sings,dances and row raps Wow rami deserves applause"
"Pharita's outfit manager deserves a raise! Rami's rap is top notch! Ruka SLAYED the intro, Ahyeon and Asa bring in their baemon energy to the video, Chiquita delivering her verse like it's no issue, and of course Rora coming in with a whole new her! Can't wait to hear the rest of the album! Remember, Monsteiz loves and will always support you!! 🫰  "

Rami's rap was amazing , Ahyeon ate it , Chiquita slayed as always, Pharita's visuals are no joke , Asa pronounciation of English words are wonderful, Ruka with her swag was just awesome , Rora can't forget about her, just  addicted to her voice "

YG말대로 기존에 시도한적없던 새로운 스타일이어서 좋다 베몬만의 정체성이 한곡한곡 쌓여가네
"We already know Ruka, Ahyeon and Asa are insane rappers but Rami?! Her rap and flow was jaw dropping. BabyMonster keeps surprising us everytime. Queens of 5th gen indeed "
"Ahyeon's unique voice and swag makes Babymonster's songs 10× better! Every group has a member who stands out, in babymonster it's definitely Ahyeon! "

Dangerously cool and pretty "
"I like ahyeon,  asa, ruka and rami rap so very amazing  and then everything so beautiful    my favorite babymonster love all person "
I’m so excited for Baemon’s album!!! 2 more days!!!
와 미쳤다 뮤비 흑백인 것도 간지나고 그냥 멤버들 랩하는거 자체가 너무 멋있음
Ahyeon's rap is simply the finishing touch of this song
"와 뮤비가 정말 소름 돋았어요, 멤버들은 아주 잘 해냈습니다.. 베이비몬스터는 최고야!!"
I’m addicted to this song omg!!!
"Pertama Ruka selalu keren. Mukanya di awal aja udah swag abis.  Partnya Ruka juga enak banget. Part rap ahyeon paling addicted dari semua lagu baemon. Dia mulai ngerap lagunya langsung berkalikali lipat lebih keren. Wow Rami, sangat berbakat. Mau nyanyi, dance, Rap semua bagus. Asa as always, flownya selalu keren, mana baddas banget lagi. Chiquita dari suara, ekspresi semua on point. Pharita suaranya tetap berkarakter meskipun suaranya ditambah efek apaan gitu. Anyway, Pharita rambut Curly cantik banget. Dek Rora cantik banget, walaupun dikit benget partnya. Sebelas dua belaslah sama pharitaa.  Lagunya bagus dan swagg ala YG. Cuma kurang suka pengulangan click clacknya. Overall Baemon selalu keren. Thankyu YG."
"Facial expressions, swag rap, outfits style,etc all are perfect and amazing, Ahyeon , 
Why are you always perfect, Ahyeon? Amazing, Amazing, Amazing"
"Ahyeon and Asaaaa omggg the flow, the swag, the ATEE"
"ภริตาคือสลัดลุค น่ารัก สวย เจ้าหญิงไปเลย 
เจอแต่ความเท่และแซ่บเลยค่า เริ่ดสุดๆ"
Ahyeon's English accent is fire and Rami just ate whole with her deep rap 
"Ahyeon and ruka ate the song, and Rami's rap!???! Omg ️‍
Baemon never dissapoints!!"
"Ahyeon queen of confidence, as always."
"Love the cool and confident vibe of the song, Rami's rap is just perfect ."
뮤비 잘 만들었다. 기존 양산형 뮤비와는 다르네. ㅋㅋ 베몬 흥해라~
"I loved the song from start to finish! BABYMONSTER came to devour, they never disappoint."
"Canny's intro with rora and pharita was amazing, Rami, Ruka and asa's rap was fire, Ahyeon was incredible. I love the MV. The served the visuals like always, and slayed the concept and song. MY FAVOURITE BAEMON SONG!!!"
"I love this song so much!!!! I have goosebumps so much!!!! I can't stop saying ""wow"" while watching this!!!!"
"Ahyeon's sass with Ruka's swag, Rami's deep voice with Asa's speedy flow. They complement each other so well. Rora, Chiquita and Pharita's rap was insane. The attitude in their voices while rapping was fire."

베이비몬스터의 멤버들은 각각 매우 재능이 뛰어납니다. YG 뮤직비디오도 흑백 톤이 잘 어울리는 것 같아요. 그리고 라미의 랩보컬도 실망을 주지 않습니다. 
"I love Pharita’s look here. Ahyeon’s confidence and rap, Ruka’s charisma and confidence and Rami omg, i love also love your rap flow you are indeed a TALENTED."
IM CRYING OMGGGG LOVE YOU SO MUCHHHHHH
이런음악이 베몬하고도 어울리고 다른그룹은 흉내못내는 그 느낌이 있어서 좋음
2:20 여기서부터 yg 맨날 갑자기 신나는 비트로 바뀌는데 여기 너무 좋음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이번에 뮤비도 그렇고 심플하게 잘 뽑았다
"OMG Rami, Ruka,Asa and Ahyeon  rap so amazing, they are so talented. This is the four we needed."
"Babymonster, you have given us another masterclass "
7명멤버 전부 실력이 좋으니 저절로 응원하게 된다
The concept gives a pure Hip hop vibe!! BABYMONSTER has become an ICONIC Group ever!! Because none of the K-pop groups have this kind of concept! All the members are an ALL-ROUNDER!
omg 이 노래 정말 미치게 만드네요. 뮤비도 멋있고 흑백이라 노래랑 잘 어울리네요.
"I love Rami's rap part most, even I know She is a vocalist. Amazing, Rami!!!!"
Rami's rap followed by Asa's rap is just perfect!!! Truly the duo we needed!
뮤비가 화려하지 않아도 일곱 멤버들의 실력만으로  충분히 빛날수 있다는 것을 증명시켜주는 음악이네요.오랜만에 음악같은 음악을 감상할수 있어서 넘 좋았어요.
"Ahyeon, really cool, her rap, everything about ahyeon, i like it, ahyeon, keep shining and keep it up"
"AMAZING, TALENTED AND PERFECT"
"정말이지..미쳤어..
못하는게 없잖아.."
"Baby Monster harus jadi artist the year tahun ini sih. mereka all rounder banget. tampang sumpah ga ada yg burik. badan bagus semua. bakat gausah dipertanyakan.
tapi emang kekurangannya adalah lagu mereka ini ga bisa diterima disemua orang apalagi knetz selera lagunya imutimut menyemenye kaya sebelah sana. jadi emang agak susah diterima.
sedangkan tipikal lagu baemon ini lebih banyak masuk ke orang2 inter..

*edit :
kalau artist the year susah ya secara saingan kakak2 senior.
minimal jadi rookie of the year harus sih"
I love the black-and-white vibe. It really goes with the song. Baemon nailed it once more!!
I love seeing most of the comments praising RAMI she really deseve this appreciation ️
