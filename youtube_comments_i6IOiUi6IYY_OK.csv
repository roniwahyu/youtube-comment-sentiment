Saka is the best he prove this  everytime by doing goal in every important match
Thomas Partey… man has been bringing it lately.
Saka and Partey were so so good man 
That pass from Ben White to Saka was amazing. 
"Bukayo Saka, i could watch you play football for hours and not get bored. What a player man we are so lucky to have him"
We are nearing perfection that's all I can say .Top quality performance from Saka and the team
Not even a Liverpool fan but that play from Nunez and Salah 
Van Dijk is just always there. He has so much presence
I’m so happy for salah to stay at Liverpool. Magic player.
""" Keep Saka's name out your mouth,  dude is world class."
"From a Liverpool fan, We didn't have Allison, but I think those goals go in anyway, there's so much quality in this Arsenal side, I actually expected a loss, You lot are actually so good you drag our performances up with you, Especially Nunez..."
"1:23 Trent long pass moves like a golf ball, Nunez didnt even hv to control it"
Running out of words to describe Saka
Saka and Party were so good
Appreciation for Salah how he crossed path when Nunez ran with ball. Quick and genius thinking. Salah was just unstoppable! 
Thomas Partey and Ben White. Give them too their flowers right now ️
Hope gabi and timbs are fit and riccy aswell we have a huge defensive crisis
"I am proud of fans who are always behind the team in bad , in good keep it up "
SakaSaka is not world class but he does this every season
Saka was soo good today. 50 PL goals now 
And there was no card for L.Dias who kicked the ball away to delay. 
"Without Saliba,Odegard,Calafiori players like Saka,Ben white,Timber just back from injury. We played good game. COYG"
Trent corner kick still dangerous
Saka's amazing goal was similar to that of  Gunners legend Dennis Bergkamp when he scored against Argentina in 1998 WC QF.
Partey put in 9/10 display
How dare Kiwior jump higher than a man standing waiting for the ball to come down. Lol the rest of the world must laugh at this refereeing as much as we do 
Konate was THE MAN OF MATCH Phenomenal Defense.
That Liverpool goal guys by Salah was well constructed and executed so sweet to watch
That finish from Saka is  on another level
fantastic goal from saka
"Martinelli such a lightweight player, so easy to dispossess, upgrade urgently needed on the left-side to take the burden off Saka in big games (Mitoma, Rodrygo, or Diaz/Gakpo, whoever is most unhappy)"
Great perform for Mo Salah
"Saka chopping it inside to his left WITH his left… inch perfect and drills it in the roof.

WORLD. CLASS ️"
Gonna be hard to drop partey once odegard is back. He's been our best midfielder this season.
amazing game! without some of our top players. Fantastic!
Saka goal reminds me Bergcamp vs Ayala
"Even though many players were out, we did our best 
We believe you guys"
Ok but why did Anthony Taylor blow.. Havertz didn't fowl anyone
Saka made Robertson sit down in 0.21
"1:43 kiwior win the header szobo didn't protest, havertz win the duel konate didn't protest too but the ref blow the whistle even TAA try to save the ball"
"Really enjoyed the game, the boys were amazing, opponents were just lucky to come out with a point."
I still don't understand how Kiwior was adjudged to have committed a foul for simply jumping to win a header. Scandalous decision there by the Ref.
"Partey hes so good , him with rice is diamond partnership"
Arsenal's defense after Gabriel left is very worrying
"Salah is so good even at this age! He is just brilliant. You don’t need to be Liverpool fan to say that.  
And Saka actually pocketed Robertson!"
What A Game By Saka
"With our current condition, I'll take that as a good result. Well done boys!!"
Diaz's nutmeg made my day 
Can't wait to play at Anfield with our full team. Great performance
"Saka is easily one of the best players in the world. He’s been immense this season, going to win the POTS and Playmaker award, watch. Martinelli Penalty and Jesus goal not given, but i’m not gonna waste my time on corruption."
"Watching anthony taylor stop the play back again is absolutely crazy as soon as we gained an advantage he cut it, let the game flow"
"Big ups lad, we've been so unlucky with these injuries, before timber and gabby got taken out we had liverpool on the ropes."
It's a shame we didn't win. Hope players are well for next matches.
Saka needs more respect. One of the most underrated wingers in the league 
I can honestly see Saka being the next one club player
Beckham  BEND IT LIKE DECLAN RICE  Those crosses were phenomenal!
"Mikel please I beg you that with the kind of current fixtures , make good substitutions, good use of talented players like Nwaneri, Joghino, Kiwior etc to minimize fatigue, injuries and change the game. Stop being too defensive when you are leading with only one goal."
As an Arsenal fan are we supposed to be watching football again? Watch your team been officiated differently. Robbed so hard that even the players sometimes are scared to express themselves on the pitch. When will this end? A lot of Arsenal fans are losing interest in football
What a goal from saka
"This is Arsenal 
This is Mikel Arteta 
This is Bukayo Saka ️"
We need another creative channel coz when saka is injured the team lacks that.. Saka was immense
Can’t believe Starboy Saka sent Robertson to the ground and scored that banger 
"As an Arsenal fan, that last goal should've been allowed"
I hate EPL referees
This is going to be an exciting race to the finish in the Premier League. Many solid teams all in striking form to take the title.
"Goal salah Coming from the position of Timber which was replaced, it should be included in Zinenko"
What a beautiful match.I love these two teams so much.And especially I love English football the most in this world.I hope that at least one of them can dethrone City's dominance and win the Premier League in the future. Maybe even both. And become the best teams.
"Every day I ask why is it always us that has to deal with all of these constant injuries, I’m praying big Gabi and JT are both ok  "
SAKAamazing
"MC will take the crown, again..."
"Salah is very smart, how he saw his chance to make that second goal..."
Am still trying to understand why the ref blow his whistle when Arsenal was about to score there 3rd goal cos i didn't see any faul in the build up.
막상막하네good & amazing game
Jakub kiwior is not yet Ready to challenge the arsenal defense
Thomas partey was so good today
"Van Dijk should've been sent off for a foul against Havertz, Arsenal should've gotten a penalty for Konate tackle on Martinelli, there was no foul for Jesus disallowed goal and we should've gotten a corner at the end..."
Saka is pure class. Arsenal 
1:23 YNWA
Why was our third disallowed I don’t see a foul
Shame it was ruined by the ref yet again
Why the blazes was that last goal disallowed
Mo Salah
"Ben Stiller, Gabri, White Rice and Sake. They're all there today, they all played their part with their pants on. As respectable as Mel & Kim."
"Great Arteta job. I was even scared without ode, saliba and when Gabi got out my condition even got worse. When I saw skelly against salahbut we managed to get a point. 
Ben white assist "
That ball from rice 
"What is stranger/amazing about the final goal is   
actually the ball was for Salah to chase,  instead very diligent N ran to the ball and Salah instantly understood and ran to the middle."
That saka goal is out of this world 
Saka de star boy 
"So, when kiwior makes the challenge, the ref doesnt react. But when Havertz gets on goal, he whistles. And no reaction from any liverpool player, not even the one who gets ""foulded"". That is not fair at all."
Saka  so good man
best league. worst refs. they'll be responsible for the downfall of epl. I'm sure there's a calciopoli-like scandal coming. mark my words
"I'm so proud of this team, even when the odds are constantly against us we stood up and made ourselves be counted. I have to say I'm really fed up with the refereeing in this league, it's no longer the Premier League as it should be the Referees' League. The only thing that is stellar right now is our own players."
Kiwior MOTM 
"As a messi fan, watching players like Salah, Saka, Palmer, Yamal is like enjoying small specific parts of Messi."
Super proud of the team. Outplayed them despite missing key players. Onto the next one. COYG!
"Saka, back on the bang."
We were cheated a third goal by the referee! He saw no foul until he realized we were about to score... Why did he hesitate so long to blow the whistle and clearly it wasn't for an advantage?
Saka is the presently the best right winger in the league. You may argue with your phone. That is fact
"It's funny how people don't consider that , Arsenal plays  Partey at RB for now, White as CB although he used to be one , Gabriel and timber were than subed due to injury which changed the game, Saka was not fully fit...they were without Odegaard, Calafiori and Saliba ,And you guys want them to win against Liverpool who only had 1 crucial player missing which is Jota i guess"
Saka’s goal reminded me of Bergkamp.
"As a football fan, that last goal should've counted. It have nothing to do with what team you back. There was no foul. If it was a foul right away the ref would've blown right there because it is no way the other team had any advantage of play. But the ref waits all that time to kill time (no) to see if the arsenal player will score (very shady indeed) also the last play should've been a corner."
uncle Partey was at his best today
Havertz was still moving and that’s a goal
M Salah 
"watch how the ref first waits, and when Havertz is through, he blows the whistle. He clearly did it intentionally. If Havertz didnt go through forward, he would have never blown that whistle. He is really unscrupulous"
What a match man!!!!
If you look closely he blows the whistle when he sees havertz is going to score
Только только Арсенал всегда в моём сердце ️️️
excellent pass from Trent
That was like mpappe finish by saka
1:41 look at how many times the ref goes to try and give a foul against us. He goes to bring his whistle up so many times. Waiting for any opportunity. It's painful to see. This is our Zapruder tape.
Pretty fair results at the end
"Taylor senses a goal threat from Kai and then blows. Great defending by the 12th man. But seriously, this is disgusting and I'm fed up of it! COYG!"
Goooooood job Arsenal. We keep on moving
Antony Taylor Was The Man Of The Match
Robertson got absolutely done
Until i die I love arsenal the gunners  like this comment 🇹🇿
Quelle passe
Martinelli's position was not given a clear penalty. The goal scored in the last minutes was cancelled. Nothing much has changed since the past years. Arsenal's rights continue to be usurped. It's such a shame.
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
If you look closely you can see the exact moment Taylor blew the whistle for a foul. As soon as havertz had a chance to score. It’s a disgrace. He didn’t call the foul until havertz headed it to himself
"Liverpool ate that game , we are tooo relaxed"
Salah super star player 
Martinelli really tried Keep it up
Yeah..the announcer was so amazed at every arsenal goals...and sound so dissapointed at every liverpool goals......oooh..it's so UNBELIEVABLE....
Ridiculous to blow a whistle for a foul when the the Liverpool player didn't even make a reaction from Kiwior's header 1:45
Should have won
Arsenal played really well! I wonder how you guys lost to Bournemouth?! Man City really has to level up if they want to win PL this year.
We deserved the win in this match ️
"We are an attacking brand, So much Respect for our manager, But he must master the art of managing the game especially  when u have three top midfielders on the field, P.R&M. He will be the first to lift UCL for gooners. This team is happy and hungry. The Refs are fuelling us"
Our rivals are left totally disgusted watching us school Liverpool with half of our first team out injured.
That's why we wanted him back
"My heart hurts, the wrong goal came from Timber's position being replaced  Arteta should have brought on zincenko"
Another top quality ref
What Arteta build and is building in Arsenal deserves respect 🫡 . YNWA
Liverpool was overrated before the game. But only to be saved by brazen corrupt referee against the  B team Arsenal... Shame!!!
Kiwior and skelly were confused. Salah knew how to capitalize and moved into space and simple finish.
Teach Havert ball controlling & finishing 
Please kindly win the league  for us
What a third goal. I think ist regular goal.
Kiwior is not good enough we need too sell him this Winter
"So looking at Saka's quality is Foden better??
I mean just look at what he did to Robertson"
Thamos was my man of the match  he was very good in number 2
The ref sold us at ast saka is youngest Arsenal player ever to score 50 goals in all competions!
"COYG Красавцы, хорошо сыграли, хоть и ничью"
"Nothing to say more...

Five years Arteta's team progress < Half years Maresca's team progress

(Most defence attitude < Most attacking attitude)

(Excuses & Biases < Adaptability & Development)"
beautiful game
2 2 against Liverpool without Saliba and Ödegaard is not bad but to become Champions Arsenal needs to step up ASAP. The width of the selection is sufficient compared to previous seasons
"Given our team's injuries, this was Liverpool's chance to make a statement and blow us out of the title race. But by the way we played, almost winning it at the end, I'd say we're still in it. Credit to the lads for giving it a good shot. Recover, and keep pushing on. COYG 
Bless up "
"Arsenal need a pure striker, come on Arsenal bring in striker Gyokeres "
"Congratulations boys...
Am worried about the injuries we got yesterday....timber, big Gabby,......cala is out ,Tommy is out ..but we trust the process"
Saka sat down shipped to Scotland and ended Robertson's career
After replay i see after Kivior wins the header the ball falls to a raised Kai arm..i think thats why the ref blows the whistle
Nice performance from the guys. Let's get back to the winning way. We are winning the title this season
Is it me or the ref only blows his whistle as soon as he realises Havertz is through haha
VVD is running back to help Robertson in the first goal like he didn't want that child
Please can someone tell me why the ref waited for Havertz to be on goal before he blew his whistle and what was foul was it for?
Next season fc hopes shattered with Salahs goal 
My main dream is to watch Arsenal playing at Emirates Stadium So help me God
"Arsenal at least avoided a red card this time. That's satisfying plus Saka, Merino back from injury and Merino getting his first Gunner goal. So despite some dropped points Arsenal are  back ontrack."
Liverpool is amazing...
"Anthony Taylor waiting for Kai to touch the ball to deny that goal is criminal.
He could've let the play unfold and let VAR look at it (And give us a red card or something, I don't know what they do anymore...)"
Liverpool occasionally moved out of first gear and got away with a draw. Arsenal was at it's level best. This says a lot for how this season will end.
Fair to say Bukayo Saka is a new Messi
Saka thật sự hay
"saka in Arsenal : 
saka in England :     "
I hope this injury and suspension crisis ends.
"Lewis-Skelly wasn't the only one to blame for 2nd goal: Martinelli lost the ball too easily in attack, and because of this Lewis-Skelly didn't have time to get back into defense.
Incidentally, Martinelli was also to blame for the first goal conceded, he lost his mark on Luis Diaz, allowing him to make an assist to Van Dijk.
In general, Martinelli plays poorly in defense, and often loses the ball in attack, which leads to effective counter-attacks on his own goal."
Ben White inherited Fabregas shirt and  brought us a Fabregas pass
this is a good film.
Martinelli was our weak point this match… so many chances were inefficiently handled by him
Thanks alot.
Why Kiwior challenge is taken as a foul?
That Ben white pass to saka is Toni kross trademark
Alhamdulilah Saka Dan Merino Buka Keunggulan Arsenal Atas Liverpool Tapi The Red Gol Penyama Virgil Dan MO Salah
"brilliant performance, but injuries really worrying hopefully we can get through this tough period with wins. what was the goal disallowed for btw?"
You can see how eager Anthony was to blow his whistle for no reason. We won 3-2 in my eyes
2-2 the best result for MC
Luis Diaz ️
Salah
Partey is in the form of his life
Saka absolutely skinned Robertson
Liverpool were unlucky to have drawn the game 
Lagi musim umpan lambung sepakbola moderan akhirnya balik lagi ke tempo dulu
Saka from Injury But still Good 
Salah is the most underrated  player of EPL
"always counter attack... always suffer.. defending like that... heartbreaker to see salah made a goal.... in to next year... we'll be bouncing back,"
GUNNERS FOR EVER
White saka 
"The game was dirty.
Played like children attacking each other, but at least Arsenal didn’t lose the game 1 point was a mentality relief .
Liverpool defence was pretty similar to Arsenal in corner and they scored too, however Merino debuted with the equalizer goal, not bad.
Not Gunner started to score sooner or history is coming back just like 3 Arteta season"
Why the pause from the refree on the last minute if there was a foul? when havertz did through the defender then he call itu foul.. 
Arsenal fans how do you like Anthony Taylor
everyone was talking ant “too many defenders” imagine if we hadn’t signed them all. we would be in a way worse place with the current injuries
"I am already waiting to go to anfield with our captain back and saliba gabriel in the center. 
Counting days....."
Lucky that Alison wasn’t playing if not Liverpool will definitely win.
Not a fan of either. But a great battle of title contenders
Ofc VAR/ref missed the two Van Dijk stud kicks at Havertz
 class goal by the boy..gutted about the result..COYG
"If Arsenal never shows their power with actions, others will bully Arsenal again and again."
Haverts will cost Arteta his job
Liverpool without salah is nothing
TAA pas is perfect
"As always, when we in good form then injuries came like a curse"
Arsenal has to bring up the refereeing issue it is unacceptable
"No way was that a foul by Kiwior! The scouser didn’t even bother jumping, just turned his back on the ball! These referees are so poor!!"
"Mo Salah owns this club, period!!!!"
I'm so disappointed in this result️. Arsenal should've won this game
Goalnya salah 
"The only problem with this team is the way them relent after scoring one, two and three...I don't know if that's arteta tactics but it ain't working that much against the Big six"
"Why we glazing saka bro,
also Im glad we drew"
The Madness came back by liverpool
Still waiting for full team
You kept playing despite mac allister being on the ground while we shot the ball out of play when Timber got injured. Just shows what kind of team you are
Saka made Arnold look like  championship material and yet he is not 100% fit
Man did a Dennis Bergkamp
"Our players need to work harder on finishing on goal! 

And Arteta needs to stop insisting on making this team play with a high defense line and playing tricks.

Before criticizing Kiwior, criticize the coach and the way he puts the team to play!"
"LFC defenders and midfielders were too conservative with passes,  except for Salah's goal just one semi-good chance to score and 1 shot on goal (for MacAllister) and it would be a miracle if he did score that (xG=0.08). In the second half LFC controlled the ball 63% but didnt create any chances from open play except for Salah's goal.  Cant win titles if you cant switch on the full out attack, especially when the opponent is vulnerable like Arsenal were, and break down the opponent."
Saka did Robo dirty
Sallah got a cheap goal. Poor defense from Kiwior
Extended highlights
"We wantt at least a major trophy dis season 
I’m tired of hearingg “ trust de process “ "
This game is another evidence that Thomas Partey is a vital part of this current Arsenal project and that is not going to change anytime soon. Of course I know he is 31 years old.
Arsenal could be the champion when pep is gone
Ben White and Partey were  good today..hope Gabriel's injury is not serious
"Liverpool fans for the past one year: 

Basketball Odegaard

This game alone:

1. Konate karate kicking Martinelli in the box without the ball - not a penalty
2. Van Dijk karate kicking Havertz twice off the ball - no VAR review of violent conduct
3. Diaz kicking the ball away when whistle was blown, no card."
We were dominating the game and we could have easily won the match but unfortunately our defenders got injured anyway well played gunners
"If there is one Arsenal FC employee feeling bad tonight, it is NJ for that poor defending for Liverpool’s equaliser from the corner. What a mess."
I forget many times this Liverpool team is playing just there 9th league match under slot. they will improve
Ты никогда не будешь один 
Salahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Watch the second goal by Arsenal, play the Video slowly by reducing the speed of the video, you will see that Arsenal players were offside even though they tried to get back on side, but they didn't they were always behind the line formed by Liverpool players. VAR shouldn't allowed that goal. It was a complete Offside goal."
This result good for city
Thanks gunners but all in all! We need a striker
No salah so amazing
Space for the citizen
"This is mad, all the Liverpool players and their no8 didn’t even expect a free kick! The ref just gave it "
The commentator is an Arsenal fun
"Arteta substituting experienced players with academy players,especially in the defense,will cost him the league."
Good jobs boys
The present one can be nice scene.
Can somebody explain to me why Havertz goal was cancelled? ️
Am beginning to hate these EPL referees. Can't we just be given an opportunity to play in Laliga coz its seems like premier league doesn't want us to participate in their league
Is anyone know what happened in the third goal ?
liverpool amzing...
"No Saliba ,has cost us."
Arnold and Robertson were ghost 
"as a liverpool fans
i have a question
why saka always good in first half"
"The fanbase here in 🇳🇬 are growing higher in belief in d wonder we are @, clubs assured of winning us home & away, now beg for a draw
Though we miss Timber & Gabriel Fernandez"
"van djik could have done something to prevent the 1st goal ,he should give cover to robertson when saka receive the ball rather than let robertson alone defence saka"
The back 4 need extra lessons on how to effectively play the offside trap. They failed miserably today…
"Arsenal's second goal was offside, I don''t know why VAR could not see that Arsenal players did actually put themselves on side after they stand offside before the ball was kicked, they tried to get back on side but they didn't completely put themselves on side at all, they were always behind the line setup by Liverpool's players. That goal was offside period! It shouldn't have been allowed to stand."
"Arteta said we will be flying, we have flown away from title race"
Любой матч арсенала и МС невозможно смотреть.
probably one of the worst officiating I've ever seen...
Why was the goal disallowed at the end I'm confused
"After 9 match, I can concluded that the biggest challenge for Arsenal this season are referee & injuries.  

I don’t mind to lose if we play poor. But I can’t accept any poor referee. Arsenal player can simply get yellow card for any reason, just touch or trip down the opponent even in attack also will get a foul or card. But opponents simply can just use their whole body to bang into our player with no foul, no penalty, no card."
Why Tailor gave that as a foul in the third goal surprises many.. It is the usual poor refereeing. We are proud regardless..
True
Nice  Top fan
"Luis Diaz play looks good but it's one touch to many, usually ends up in opponents hands or right footer shot wide."
That goal should’ve stood.. what a joke of a ref. He waited for the chance to be clear on goal before signalling a foul (which is also not a foul)
Pep is chiling 
"Also also, the sideline official was either blind or corrupt for not giving us corner kick in the last second of the game."
Вы нас огорчили
"Premier league officiating is getting worse everyday , pure corruption "
"How Arsenal was playing every time :

Attack, Control the game, Scored.

Drop off early, let the opposition control the game, Conceded.

Repeat."
Star Boy
Not a good performance by Small Gabi and Kai but as Arteta said Kai needs love he needs to feel protected around him. But he didn’t feel protected because there are number of players injured. So lets move on and focus on Newcastle
1:38 You can CLEARLY see the ref blow the whistle only when he realises Havertz is in to score a goal. Liverpool's No.8 didn't have a clue about a foul or that a foul was given against him. Robbed
Nice
That was suppose to be the winning goal. Keeper didn't touch the ball and didn't even shake him or fell him down.
Why is Antony Taylor still allowed to Referee Arsenal games? Same guy allowed a much more obvious foul against Newcastle last season which ultimately cost us.
Timber he is good player but not Constance because injury 
We are LIVERPOOL
Even though i'm on lfc side i still couldn't figuring out what makes him blow the whistle 1:37
Where is Tomiyasu and Saliba?
Lewis skelly forgot that he came on as LB.   Where was he for the goal 
Shaka should come to united to save us as a messiah
"Question.
On Liverpool's 2 goal, Salah influenced the play when Trent passed the ball. Shouldn't the referee call for an offside?"
"Salah 32 years of age, and two Arsenal defenders are left far behind. How come?"
"Length of time VAR took over the Merino  goal. They were desperate not to give it. 
Havertz, where was the foul? The refs will not let us win the prem under any circumstances. Mansours got every base covered. Congrats to City on 5 and 6 in a row"
SZOBO is a key player for LFC!
If Big Gab and Timber were still on they would’ve denied the 2nd Liverpool goal
"At least this time, the video title cannot manipulate to fictitious victory of Arsenal."
"This highlight did not show where the dark-art FC goalkeeper and players where falling and lying down on the field. As their new skill, it should be included in highlights"
Now I understand why Mikel Arteta keep on buying defender..
"At the start of the season, we were boasting about our defence. Only air can pass through our back four. That's what we said. And now...
Saliba - Injured
Tomiasu - Injured
Calafiori - Injured
Gabriel - Substituted (Hope it is not serious)
Timber - Substituted (Hope it is not serious)

Help us God!"
Arsenal has players who are not winners. 2nd or 3rd place in table.
"I keep watching that disallowed goal… why doesn’t ref blow the whistle immediately after the “foul”, fully how no LFC players were appealing… he barely touched him he just jumped to win the header. Should have been 3-2 imo"
Arsenal since Wenger days are disturbed by set pieces.  Lucky to get a point.
Fans out here wailing about our transfer season... Yet both our signing have produced pivotal goals in their first 4 starts for us... Stop whining and let the coach coach...
Arsenal has been flying
now i'm sure no one would complain if arteta spends next transfer window getting 5 CB's and 5 Wb's 
Salah positioning to expect pass to score a goal
"WHY ALL THIS REFFS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL THIS RUBBISH OFFICIATING, HOW WAS HAVARTZ GOAL WAS DISALLOWED IS WHAT I CANT UNDERSTAND ️"
Arsenal 
"Chelsea is now 1 point behind Arsenal with a better GD. Liverpool  and City are still above Arsenal, this was a good day at the office"
"As long as Guardiola is the manager of City, Arteta and Arsenal are just a participant."
Anthony Taylor just decided to make up a foul for Liverpool immediately he realized we're beating them... I don't know how we are going to survive with all the hatred and biasness from the PL REFEREES
"Our players are dropping like flies!
And I don't get why our winning goal was denied"
Partey was so good
Nunez
"How is it a foul by kiwior for the 3rd goal? also, how delayed is the ref's whistle. He blows it way after it only when we are clear through."
Tapas Pulis always defends deep when we go up. That's not how you win the league.
Dont waste your time in Arsenal. You got nothing Saka.
COYG ️️
Should've won  but this quite the result despite the injuries
We only need salah
Emirates Stadium A.K.A Salah playground 
Commentator hates Liverpool for sure ! 
City we on top
Ynwa️
Martinelli was so poor
I still don't know why that goal was disallowed
as a barca fan impressivee
What has taylor whistled in the third goal by Arsenal?
"PGMOL’s Premier League.. We should have joined the Super League. Nevertheless, onto the next one!"
"Please, guys, where was the foul coming from with Arsenal 3rd goal"
What did the ref blow the whistle for?
another underwhelming game from the Gunners.
"Arsenal without martin, their game is a mess"
David Raya should have done better to safe those second goal by being aggresive taking the initiative
Miss odegaard 
"Again we lose points cheaply while Manchester City slips through in the last minutes, I don't understand these Arteta changes where he puts in young inexperienced players of 17,18 years old."
Haverts didn't make any faul whatsoever Tyler just got it wrong
Blowing the whistle there should be a prison sentence
Robertson defending leading to saka goal was so poor
Hope we all inform that we not gunning for premier league this season
"As optimistic as i would like to be, city will not give up a 5 nil lead, they unfortunately won their 5 straight premier league title"
English officiating is just despicable
Am I the only one who felt we dropped 2 points this game??.. We are 2-1 up.. playing at home .. with 11 men!.. just because Gabi got injured.. why should that make us concede possession so much.. our back line is good enough to beat the press and hold the ball. We kept thumping it forward hoping Kai could hold the ball up and get a foul. This defensive mentality when we are up is going to kill us this season
Good one for arsenal
If that was haaland they would allow that havertz goal lol ngl
Nahh did kai havertz just kiss saka after his goal 
Im United supporter but i think Liverpool deserves to win PL and City must be stopped
"As optimistic as i would like to be, city will not give up a 5 nil lead, they unfortunately won their 5 straight premier league title"
"That Moreno goal was an offside
VAR robbed Liverpool there"
"Havertz, Jesus, TAA and Kelleher should all have received yellow cards for playing on after the whistle there. Clearly delayed the restart."
why did he wait? why was he waiting to whistle? why are premier league refferes so inconsistent
why did he wait? why was he waiting to whistle? why are premier league refferes so inconsistent
"Kita butuh pemain sayap kiri yang lebih bisa menekan, tanpa membuang banyak peluang"
Kiwior is ready
Who is foul in the Arsenal last minute goal..?
Our team Arsenal
"Without Saka, Arsenal is nothing. Gosh the lengths they went to to get him to play"
There was no offside if so why could the lines man raise the flag and if the referee so the offside from where he was standing its so amazing
Has anyone noticed how we're losing a player every match..like if it's not a red card.. it's injuries.. First Saliba red card then Calafiori injury and now Gabriel injury.. consecutively
I don't like highlights without time line
damn ref saw that havertz might score then he decides to blow the whistle ️️
"Bukayo , starboy"
Take the draw but I am not liking the amount of injuries we are picking up
How the HELL was that a foul!!?? Robbed!! Anthony Taylor  you MUPPET - NO Liverpool player complains
Saka is more important than Ode?? 
you guys should have bagged all 3 points
Cakep... 1 point penting
Kiwior Kiwior Kiwior
"Kiwior need to more aggresive,.. and read the game quickly"
We conceeded second one defending like we Barrow FC
No foul by kiwior. Szob was too slow and did not even jump for that header
Liverpool 
We tied but I know Arsenal will win the 2024/25 Premier League️ (GG Liverpool).
"I can't stand with this mentality, every time we're ahead then suddenly we sit tight on defense. Feels like small club try to secure win against big team, what a shame. Every counter attack nobody running, there always someone to delay and backpass again, WE AIN'T GOING NOWHERE WITH THIS MENTALITY.

WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT OUR HALF SQUAD IS ONLY BETA."

"Thanks Mo Salah, you saved the world from noise pollution of the team with no titles "
"People Havert miss a sitter, we would have been 3-1 at half time, these kind of chances are clinical in a big game like this"
I feel sorry for Robertson
Roberson needs to improve man …but I’ll take a draw away from home
Why did Antony Taylor disallow that goal
"Arteta putting skelly instead of zinchenko i knew we will not win that game, zinchenko is liability defensively but why gamble for a young boy who has not played such kinds of game."
how tf was tje last goal dissalowed?? nothing wrong at all with it
Saka scored and he wasn’t even in the thumbnail 
The referee is against us again. The last corner was not awarded
How the hell is that header at 1.44 through to Havertz a foul on the Liverpool player?
"Arsenal and Liverpool played, MC won"
Ok let's be honest what was wrong with Arsenal's 3 goal
better team liverpool bigger club great result from home

how is the kiwior header a foul? can someone please explain it to me? and why did he whistle when havertz got the ball over the keeper?
What was the foul for at the end? The header or the slightly high foot that didn't get close to anyone! BS ref and officials don't want Arsenal to win. ️
Why not show the blatant violent conduct by VVD who kicked out TWICE and left our man in a heap on the floor? The most blatant red you'll ever see.
Man City win the title again this year no one can stop them
"If referee doing double standard to Arsenal, so we have to face it and do more hardwork and minimze the fault"
Why was Havertz goal disallowed 
Without saliba we concede in set piece.
This Commentator is supporting Arsenal 
"Saka  
Old MUN Cristiano celebration"
Vamos
"Arsenal have become proper Mourinho team. It was evident in 2nd half after Gabriel injury. With red card 10 man, it is totally understandable. But, with 11 on field, team like Arsenal parking bus plus devoid of attacking ideas through the middle is not looking good.
Further, Arsenal holding midfielder no 6 don't arrive in box and no 10 creativity/ dribling/direct play is totally missing. It is all wingers or set pieces."
Muhammad Salah
Luis Diaz should loan to Dundee fc
It was Arsenal vs VAR.
COYG
Why are we playing against 12 in every game this season ?
Time to take legal action against  Howard webb and his cronies. Eversince Arteta called the PGMOL a disgrace Arsenal  have been getting on the wrong end of ref's decisions .In today's  game 3 atrocious decisions by the ref .1. VVD should have been red carded for his violent attack on Havertz. 2 Martinelli should have been awarded a penalty when he was taken out by Konate. 3. Arsenal's 3rd goal wrongly disallowed  when kiwior  made a fair 50/50 challenge  for the ball.
Taylor or any ref. Desperate to find a reason to stop arsenal scoring
We're cooked if we keep performing like this
"Please can somebody in the life of me explain to me why that third goal was disallowed??? 

Is everything okay with these refs? 1:50"
That Liverpool lb 
"1:28 If United's player in this position, they will choose shoot the ball rather give an assist"
Win for City
Arsenal 
"Musim lalu adalah peluang terbaik untuk juara EPL, dan kita melewatkannya"
not bad
"After 9 match, I can concluded that the biggest challenge for Arsenal this season are referee & injuries."
"Arsenal,is"",winned""never

"Martineli, kiwior sell"

wow goll
2 time  with the same score
"We needed the 3 points. Even though we often look great like we did, we won't win the league like this. It will be another close entertaining season with high hopes and then disappointment. I'm not holding my breath sorry."
"arsenal get humbled , This is liverpool"
"The referee cowardly blew the whistle. Great headers from Kiwior and Havertz. Should’ve been 3-2. Then, not giving Arsenal the corner when it obviously was."
Saka who failed to convert penalty at euro final
The second goal of Liverpool should have  been checked by arsenal defender... Should have body check salah
Kiwior
Kiwior decision and Harvetz decision - quite clearly Arsenal is targeted by referees this season

Arsenal fans says saka is better than prime messi..really??
0:59 Diaz selfish 
"Arteta listen to me carefully, there are many injuries and you are right about this, today with Partey as a full-back you were just lucky because he is very slow... and it went well for you... you were winning 2-1 you could have managed the advantage better instead you gave the field free to Liverpool...you gave Nuno Tavares to Lazio and he became very strong..and you lack defenders...do you understand football? You lost another season"
"I am extremely proud of Arsenal’s performance and guts. I think what the boys and Arteta have done so far this season is of the highest quality. 

However, honestly, I can’t stand watching PL refereeing anymore. I will continue to follow Arsenal on the other competitions but, at present, I have completely lost interest due to the asymmetrical refereeing against Arsenal! "
But why arsenal was denied last goal
Lets face it...We were up fookin 2-1 ..at our home ground..and we gave them the initiative to have the upper hand...We  shudve gone for the kill..a 2 goal cushion is always better...Sorry..this one's on Arteta..he missed the PLOT
Look at Robinson what a poor defending 
If you're an arsenal fan and you're hoping for anything good from this club then you are still sleeping on a bicycle...
UNSPORTING from havertz as he pushed trent in the last goal. arsenal is the biggest premier league disgrace
How were you guys robbed ?? it was a clear foul to szoboszlai.
Kiwor would have been tackled Salah 
LIVERPOOL MO SALAH
"Bek pada cidera, untuk 2-2"
Arsenal ️️️️️️️
I hope all English referees live happily with their 'wisest' decisions and don’t regret their official choices.
"Arteta need top class left winger, Martineli won't do, all the best team in the world have 2 top class wingers. Btw 1:44, blud literally blow the whistle when he saw Havertz about to score a goal, they didn't even hide it anymore "
Whay???? if win always thing to defent
"What is wrong with the header for Ref to blow. England las the worst Referees in the whole of Europe, I have never seen this."
SAKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beating Liverpool is not easy
Why does saka always copy celebrations?
Robertson
3rd goal should have counted
It feels like a lost to me..
"Sell Jakub Kiwior as soon as possible in January.
Poor position in Liverpool's second Goal."
"You cannot beat Arsenal
Offf yess we have Referees who can help us!!!!
Shame on you Premier League!!!!"
Whistle already still wants to kick it into goal. Should give red card.
Virgil controlled u lot
So close
"Miles can play as a defender, but he just isn't.. the instinct to track your man isn't just there . Not discrediting his positivity on the ball tho"
why all like this

"Virgil van Dijk won more duels (7), made more clearances (6) and won more aerial duels (5) than any other Liverpool player against Arsenal. 

And he scored his first league goal of the campaign."
We shall meet at anfield
Not an Arsenal fan but where is havertz foul?
"The end of the game was weird. Ni celebration from none, especially from Arsenal coz we almost had it"
Why does this team plays like Atletico Madrid? it's not fun to watch anymore.
Stay humble eh 🫳
I think harvezt can only play in midfield not striker.if he upfront he like German Bendtner.his leg like pillow not spring like messi.thats why he always miss.
Pls how's that a foul Liverpool player bent when kiwor headed the ball pls how....
nice draw
Where is the mistake l can't see any off side n the ball was headed up no fault
So jumping is deemed foul play now. Noted.
"Minimal gak kalah, walau babak ke 2 dar der dor "
Wenger said that you pay for a young player's education with points. MLS at 1:24 
Arsenal second goal was clear offside
Please someone explain this 1:43 ?
Too bad we've has some tough games in. Red cards and injuries but i really dont like Arteta and Jesus' situation.
"Well there goes our season. . I am still not convinced by Havertz, he will not get us the title."

I hope were win this match!! Im so disappointed "
...lets now show all club matches highlights from around the world...but the truth is nobody cares 
I'm only here to laugh at Arsenal bottling company 
So Arsenal got more injuries trying to beat Liverpool. A sign of trying to punch above your weight.
Virjil should be carded

If arsenal first team players were fit. It would have been an easy win.

In there stadium up liverpool
How you gonna punish a player by calling a foul where he wins it in the air by header that is ridiculous. The other player just stands there under the ball and had no Intention of jumping for it this game is ruined by refs. The simplest way to improve reffing is to get people who have actually played the game be a simple compulsory thing because having a random geek who’s never stepped a foot on the pitch ref a game like that ends up with calls that are ridiculous
GG
Arsenal won the game but England FA can't allow arsenal to win 
They took one goal from Arsenal
Fly arteta...fly........ YNWA

Good news for Man City.
The true winner in this match is Man City

Kiwior oh kiwior...
"The ref doesn't want arsenal to win, ask a psychologist to analyse the ref's behavior.."
Arteta out 
Arsenal  were denied a clear goal
"For the disallowed goal, there are 3 possible fouls there.
1. Kiwior jumped and pushed over Sobo
2. Harvertz handball when receiving ball from Kiwior
3. Harvertz bumped Arnold into the net (Arnold kicked the ball first).

Each of the above can disallow it."
Is not  easy
"arsenal fc
defense fc pro max"
wow
Same song since last epl title ...arsenal will win this league.x 100
Both teams scored by lefty right wings and set pieces.  Close rivalries! Ref also kept up his poor performance as usual.
Thanks to both teams in the name of all Man City fans
3rd goal denied by pgmol
Haverts lost us the game
why there is non penalty
это ккой год
LiVARpool and there 12th man was MoM
Kiwior is bad.
Partey get cooked by Diaz 
"The ref blew the whistle when he saw the arsenal were scoring, why didn't he blow the whistle when the ball was headed? Stupid refs of epl. They hate arsenal i don't know why."
Martinelli is old already.
Arsenall
Partey but NO party 
refs always against arsenal
"Some random club in Romania has more European heritage than arsenal 
Can't win at home"
Really really disappointed this season arsenal not great at all always problems and something happens always to arsenal

Arsendallll
Watch carefully at anthony taylor he was looking at the ball in the air and after havertz won the ball he blew the whistle. Corrupt as always
nice arsenal
Ben white can pass
"Arsenic already bottled their season 
About time them injuries came along, longay it continue.
It's so cool you got a clueless manager.
The new Tottenham Hotspur, season is finished already and there is no hope for the future."
"3-2*

Just bad referee that made it 2-2"
Anthony Taylor ️🫠
Kai goal 
Both teams are poor in defence
Riley is an absolutely abominable referee.  He's given handball against Haverz when when the ball clearly comes of the t-shirt line part of his arm.
Vincent dan Desta imbang

"Bad officiating week in week out always against Arsenal.


EPL corruptions is second to none!!!

"Dear friends, as believers in one Creator, we find purpose in worshiping ALLAH alone. The Quran (51:56) says that humans and jinns were created solely to worship Him. We see the Quran as the final divine scripture, guiding humanity to truth and righteousness. In Islam, we hold that all prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all — were sent by ALLAH to guide people towards monotheism. Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the last messenger, with the Quran as the ultimate revelation for humanity.

The path to true success in the hereafter, we believe, is through sincere worship of Allah, the one true God. May we all seek and understand each other's faiths with open hearts, aiming for peace, guidance, and unity.

Please read Quran and your book for two hours. You will find the truth. You will find all the answers in Quran."
