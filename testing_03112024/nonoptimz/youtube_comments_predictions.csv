@quranversesdaily_,8 hours ago,,"Dear friends, as believers in one Creator, we find purpose in worshiping ALLAH alone. The Quran (51:56) says that humans and jinns were created solely to worship Him. We see the Quran as the final divine scripture, guiding humanity to truth and righteousness. In Islam, we hold that all prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all — were sent by ALLAH to guide people towards monotheism. Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the last messenger, with the Quran as the ultimate revelation for humanity.

The path to true success in the hereafter, we believe, is through sincere worship of Allah, the one true God. May we all seek and understand each other's faiths with open hearts, aiming for peace, guidance, and unity.

Please read Quran and your book for two hours. You will find the truth. You will find all the answers in Quran.",dear friend believer one creator find purpose worshiping allah alone quran say human jinns created solely worship see quran final divine scripture guiding humanity truth righteousness islam hold prophet abraham moses jesus muhammad peace upon sent allah guide people towards monotheism muhammad pbuh regarded last messenger quran ultimate revelation humanity path true success hereafter believe sincere worship allah one true god may seek understand faith open heart aiming peace guidance unity please read quran book two hour find truth find answer quran,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
