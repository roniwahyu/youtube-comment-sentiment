In Islam, we hold that all prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all — were sent by ALLAH to guide people towards monotheism. Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the last messenger, with the Quran as the ultimate revelation for humanity.

The path to true success in the hereafter, we believe, is through sincere worship of Allah, the one true God. May we all seek and understand each other's faiths with open hearts, aiming for peace, guidance, and unity.
